# Graduation project

For your graduation, you’ll need to write two pieces of content:

1. Promoting a communist farm in the outskirts of Tokyo.  
2. Promoting the ideas of market economy and lean government to the inner circle of the Chinese Communist Party.

You decide on the ideal format for each of these pieces.

For each of these pieces, plan how the audience will find the content and what actions you want readers to take. Explain how you will measure if the content works successfully.

As background material, you need to read the following two books:  
[The Communist Manifesto](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYMGP6P4), Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels  
[Why Government Is the Problem](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074TLJLWM), Milton Friedman

Each of these books takes about a week to read. Start your reading as you begin our course, so that you’ll be ready to produce your graduation project at the end of the course.
