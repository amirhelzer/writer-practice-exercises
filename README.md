# Practice What You Learned

## Graduation project

For your graduation, you’ll need to write two pieces of content:

1. Promoting a communist farm in the outskirts of Tokyo.  
2. Promoting the ideas of market economy and lean government to the inner circle of the Chinese Communist Party.

You decide on the ideal format for each of these pieces.

For each of these pieces, plan how the audience will find the content and what actions you want readers to take. Explain how you will measure if the content works successfully.

As background material, you need to read the following two books:  
[The Communist Manifesto](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYMGP6P4), Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels  
[Why Government Is the Problem](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074TLJLWM), Milton Friedman

Each of these books takes about a week to read. Start your reading as you begin our course, so that you’ll be ready to produce your graduation project at the end of the course.

## Practice per chapter

| Chapter | Practice |
| :---- | :---- |
| All content matters. | Use your own personal experience and describe several pieces of content, which people would usually label as “technical material” or “unimportant” and explain how they can be done correctly to drive business results. |
| We’re busy. Be concise. | Take a piece of successful long-form content and show how you can cut it in half and still keep the gist. |
| People are human. Write for humans. | Take the piece that you used in the previous exercise and apply behavioral psychology to it. Explain the purpose of your edits. |
| Understand your audience. | Pick two pieces of content, one that perfectly addresses the target audience and one that looks at readers as “generic viewers”. Explain why one does a good job and the other does a poor job at understand the audience. |
| There’s always a funnel. Understand it and optimize each step. | Pick an example for a content campaign that you know and explain its funnel. Aim for a campaign which doesn’t have an obvious search-\>landing page-\>sign-up funnel. |
| Research your topic. | Pick a product that we’re offering, research it and explain it in simple terms. |
| Creating internal links | Pick an important page on one of our sites, which is suffering from poor internal links. Suggest where you’d link to it and why. |
| Working with others to build incoming links | Pick a topic that’s close to you. Identify sites that could promote that topic. Explain why the owners of these sites would be interested, what’s in it for them and what kind of content on their site could promote your topic. |
| Analyzing content opportunities | Pick your favorite hobby. Suggest content that will get others to participate. Propose where to publish this content. Analyze the whole thing and rate the likelihood of this project to succeed. Explain what success looks like. |
